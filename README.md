Odin Project's Foundations project "Recipes"

The goal of this project is to validate all the instructions from the HTML tree of the Foundations part of the Odin Project.

This goal will be achieved by creating a static website composed of multiple webpage, to display multiple recipes using what can be found in the related part of the Odin Project.

An alternative goal of this project is to be more used to Git, and to validate the basics learned during this course.
